# Overall Design

This build creates a fold-out sleeping plaform that stores behind the 3rd row bench seats. It works in combination with a rear cabinet to create a platform approximately 49in wide by 74in long. When stored, it takes up minimal interior space or storage space, allowing folks to use the middle section of the van for whatever their heart desires. 

## Features

* Big, comfy sleeping platform.
* Folds flat to rear seat backs when not in use. 
* Sides of sleeping platform can be used independently. 
	* When just one side is deployed, it can be used as a side table inside. 
* Provides a relatively large "kitchen" area of 18.5" x 51". And plenty of storage space underneath
* Simple materials and tools to build

## Installation and Use

### Installation 

*Link to video*

*Approx. 10 minutes*

**Folding Platforms**

1. (from rear) Position platforms in rear trunk. Slide unthreaded seat cam straps through the gap between back/base of seat. 
2. (from inside) Pull through cam straps so they are accessible after seats are folded
2. (from rear or inside) Lay down rear seats. 
3. (from rear) Slide platform into place on back of seat. 
2. (from inside) Slip headrest strap over headrest. Tighten headrest strap. Thread and tighten seat cam straps. 
4. (from inside) Raise seats into sitting position. 

**Rear cabinet**

1. Put rear cabinet into position (install it before any cargo)
2. Attach and tighten turnbuckles. 
3. Load up your oodles of stuff!

### Bed Deploy

*Approx. 2-3 min*

1. (from inside) Lay down seats (one or both)
2. (from inside) Loosen cam straps slightly, and slide off to each side. Don't undo them completely. 
2. (from inside or rear) Pull upwards on platform and reach through gaps to wedge ensure supports have deployed. 
3. (from rear) Slide in support cross-braces through gaps or via overhang of rear cabinet. Push platform slightly forward to ensure it's properly in place. 
4. (from inside) Fold out foot of bed onto supports (either coolers/tables or folding legs.) 

To put into travel mode, reverse the above, slipping cam straps over the platforms and tightening before raising the seats. 

## Known Bugs or Areas of Improvement

* Does not have self-supporting legs for the foot of the bed. 
	* Addition of these legs will narrow the depth of the cabinet top and create a slightly larger gap between sections of the bed. 
	* We use an 18" high cooler and an 18" high pop-up table. We like this modular solution for a variety of reasons, but it does require both to be in place to use both sides. 
* The strapping solution is inelegant and could be improved. 
* Access to the pop-up support cross-brace is doable but finnicky.

## Q&As

* Can this platform be deployed with middle seats installs?
	* TBD.
