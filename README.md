# WeekenderVan

This repository contains plans for a a folding sleeping platform that fits in a Gen 3 Toyota Sienna. 

If others modify these plans to fit a different vehicle, please create them in a new director and request an update to this file.

### Build Goals

- No permanent modifications to the vehicle.
- A full-size sleeping platform.
- Retain ability to carry 5 legal passengers when camping, and all 7 (or 8) when not. 
- Simplicity where possible. 
- Reduce wasted space when not in use. 
- Durable, accessible, and affordable materials. 
- As few tools as necessary. 
- Installation/removal of setup should take < 10min. Converting to/from sleeping mode < 3min. 

### Inspiration

Not everyone needs a full size, built out, luxury van that costs buckets of money. But they also might not want to sleep in a tent. They may need to carry a bunch of folks during the weekend, but get out for the night with just one other (or themselves!) for the weekend. Minivans are a great platform to cover all these needs without owning an extra vehicle or buying an RV.
